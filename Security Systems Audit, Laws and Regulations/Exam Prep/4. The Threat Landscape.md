## 2. Economics of Security (IBM 2025)

1. ### Cost Drivers

- **Detection and Escalation** are major cost centers.
- **Cloud:** Breaches in public clouds are often more expensive and harder to contain.

2. ### Cost Reducer

- The extensive use of **AI and Automation** in security is the biggest factor in reducing the cost and containment time of a data breach.

2. ### Top Target

- **Public Administration (Government)** is a primary target in the EU.
