# Technical Controls (ITGC)

Goal: Apply the audit process to specific technical domains.

## 1. Logical Access

1. ### Segregation of Duties (SoD)

- Ensure no single person can initiate and approve a transaction.

2. ### Shared Accounts

- Use of generic IDs (e.g., "Admin1") is a **control failure** because accountability is lost.

3. ### Lifecycle

- Audit the **"Joiners, Movers, Leavers"** process.

## 2. Change Management

1. ### Separation of Environments

- **Development $\neq$ Production.**
- **Critical Rule:** Developers must **never** have write access to the Production environment.

2. ### Testing

- Changes require **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** evidence from the business side, not just IT.

3. ### Emergency Changes

- Must be documented immediately and approved retrospectively (e.g., next day).

## 3. IT Operations & Resilience

1. ### Backups

- Defining **RTO** (Time) and **RPO** (Data Loss) is not enough.
- You must verify **Restoration Tests**. A backup is useless if it cannot be restored.

2. ### Logging

- Logs are only a valid control if they are **reviewed**. Logging without review is a failure.

## 4. Physical Security

1. ### Fire Suppression

- **Allowed:** Gas (Inert, FM-200, Halon replacement).
- **Forbidden:** Water or Dry Pipe systems in the server room itself (damages electronics).
