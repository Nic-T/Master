# The Audit Lifecycle (The Process)

Goal: Master the chronological steps of performing an audit (ITAF 1200 Series).

## 1. Planning (Risk Assessment)

1. ### Risk-Based Approach (Standard 1201)

- You cannot audit everything. You must perform a risk assessment to allocate resources to high-risk areas.

2. ### The "Hierarchy of Criteria"

- **1. Statutory Requirements (Laws):** Always take priority.
- **2. Standards:** (e.g., ISO, internal policy).
- **Exam Tip:** If Corporate Policy conflicts with the Law (e.g., Norma 4), the **Law wins**.

3. ### Constraints

- If you run out of time/budget, you do not cut random scope; you **prioritize the highest risk areas**.

## 2. Fieldwork (Evidence Collection)

1. ### Evidence Rule (Standard 1205)

- Evidence must be **Sufficient** (Quantity) and **Appropriate** (Quality/Relevant).

2. ### Testing Hierarchy

- **Compliance Testing:** Does the control exist/work? (Attribute sampling).
- **Substantive Testing:** Does the data look right? (Testing details/integrity).

3. ### Reliability Hierarchy (Strongest to Weakest)

- **Re-performance / Observation:** Auditor does/sees it directly (**Strongest**).
- **Inspection:** Reviewing documents/logs.
- **Inquiry:** Asking management (**Weakest** - must be corroborated).

4. ### Using Work of Others

- You can use external experts (e.g., a pen-tester).
- **Requirement:** You must first assess their **competence, independence, and objectivity**.

5. ### Sampling

- **Statistical Sampling:** Random selection (unbiased).
- **Judgmental Sampling:** Based on auditor's suspicion (biased, used for fraud detection).

## 3. Reporting & Follow-Up (The Output)

1. ### Drafting Findings

- A finding requires:
    - **Criteria** (What should be)
    - **Condition** (What is)
    - **Cause** (Why)
    - **Effect** (Impact)

2. ### Follow-Up (Standard 1402)

- The auditor monitors remediation.
- Management implements the fix.
- **Trap:** If management accepts the risk, the auditor’s job is done **unless** the risk is illegal or existential. In that case, **report to the Board**.
