# Rules of the Game (Frameworks & Regulations)

## 1. The Audit Framework (ITAF)

The Information Technology Assurance Framework (ITAF) is the primary rulebook for auditors. You must know its structure and ethical boundaries.

1. ### The Structure (Memorize the Series)

- **1000 Series (General Standards):** Applies to **YOU** (Ethics, Independence, Skills).
- **1200 Series (Performance Standards):** Applies to the **WORK** (Planning, Evidence, Supervision).
- **1400 Series (Reporting Standards):** Applies to the **OUTPUT** (Reporting findings, Follow-up).

2. ### Independence vs. Objectivity

- **Organizational Independence (Standard 1002):** The audit function must report to the highest level (Board/Audit Committee), not to the management they are auditing (e.g., reporting to the CIO is a conflict of interest).
- **Objectivity (Standard 1003):** An individual mental attitude of being unbiased.
- **The "Red Line":** An auditor loses independence if they design, implement, or configure controls. They keep independence if they only advise/consult.
- **Trap:** You cannot audit a system you helped build.

3. ### Proficiency (Standard 1006)

- Auditors must possess adequate skills.
- If you lack the technical skills for a specific audit (e.g., AI or Mainframe), you must decline the work or hire an external expert.

## 2. The Regulatory Landscape (Local & Global)

You must map specific requirements to specific laws.

1. ### Local Romanian Laws

- **Norma 4/2018 (ASF - Financial/Insurance):**
    - **Scope:** Non-banking financial entities.
    - **Mandates:** Yearly risk assessment, yearly vulnerability scanning, periodic penetration testing.
    - **Key Control:** Multi-Factor Authentication (2FA) is mandatory for external access.
- **Order 553/2019 (Internet Banking):**
    - **Scope:** Payment instrument issuers (Banks).
    - **Mandates:** Annual risk evaluation and annual penetration tests.
    - **Certifications:** Distinguishes between Auditors (CISA, CISSP) and Pen-testers (OSCP, CEPT, LPT).
- **Law 135/2007 (Electronic Archiving):**
    - **Mandate:** Data centers storing electronic archives must be audited/authorized every 3 years.

2. ### International Regulations

- **GDPR (EU):** Focuses on personal data protection. Consent must be unambiguous and revocable at any time.
- **Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX - US):**
    - **Section 404:** Requires assessment of internal controls over financial reporting (Key for IT audits).
    - **Section 302:** Management disclosure controls.

## 3. Framework Comparison (COBIT vs. ISO)

1. ### ISO 27001 vs. ISO 27002

- **ISO 27001:** The Requirements (**Certification**). Focus is **Compliance** (checking the "box").
- **ISO 27002:** The Code of Practice (Controls/Guidelines). You use this to implement 27001.
- **ISO 27001 vs. ITAF:** ISO 27001 is for **Compliance**, ITAF is for **Assurance** (checking if risks are actually managed).

2. ### COBIT 5

- Focus is **Governance** (Aligning IT with Business).
- **Core:** Know the **5 Principles** (e.g., Meeting Stakeholder Needs) and **7 Enablers**.
- **Principle 5:** Separates Governance from Management.
- **Domain MEA04:** The specific domain for Assurance/Auditing.

3. ### The Conflict Rule

- If you cite **ITAF** in your audit charter, and ITAF conflicts with another standard, **ITAF prevails**.
